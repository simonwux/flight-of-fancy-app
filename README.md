## Project Objective

People would love to have some happy moments and be amused by some “useless and unrealistic” ideas. We want to build an app with pages not that serious and not that “useful”. 

Flight-of-Fancy App is  an app where people can create some content that is out of box. Something that may be improper to speak it out during normal situations. LoL!
